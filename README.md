📊 Medical Inventory Optimization

🔍 Description

This project focuses on optimizing the medical inventory system in a pharmacy setting that is experiencing increased bounce rates—patients leaving without receiving their medications due to stockouts. The aim is to analyze inventory data to uncover inefficiencies, forecast demand, and reduce stockouts or overstocking. This analysis will drive patient retention, improve operational efficiency, and ultimately reduce revenue loss.

By leveraging Python , and Power BI, we aim to develop actionable insights and recommendations to enhance inventory decision-making.
